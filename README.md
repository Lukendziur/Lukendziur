Hi! I'm Lu, a front-end developer from Argentina. I relish when facing challenges as they allow me to learn a little more every day. Teamwork, code documentation, and accessibility are the three utmost important pillars of my work. Furthermore, I believe that I stand out for developing user interfaces that are accessible to everyone as in this ever growing world it is even more important to enable people with diverse abilities and methods to access effectively and efficiently breaking down the barriers.
